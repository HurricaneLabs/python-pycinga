Pycinga |release| Documentation
====================================

Overview
--------

**Pycinga** is a Python library for writing `Icinga <http://www.icinga.com/>`_
plug-ins. Writing an Icinga plug-in typically involves conforming to a
`large list of guidelines <https://www.monitoring-plugins.org/doc/guidelines.html>`_,
and this library removes the boilerplate necessary in writing your own
plug-ins.
